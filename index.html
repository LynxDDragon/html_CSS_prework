				More Interesting Things About Me
			</h1>

			<article> 
				These are mostly random fun facts, they aren't in any particular
				order. If you are interested in hearing more detailed stories about 
				these little snippits, you can always private me. And I'll respond
				if I am not busy.

					<li>I lived the first 4 years of my life in a corner store. It was
						kind of odd though. Because it wasn't the typical store.
						It was like an early concept of a vending machine. There was
						a window where the client could see everythin on display.
						And they would just say what they wanted and my grandmother
						would put it on the counter. So no one ever actually went
						into the store which also doubled as our house. We had the
						store section, we also had a kitchen that was also the 
						dining room, A "pila" room, a bathroom, and a singular
						bedroom where we had like 3 beds... the bedroom was 
						literally a <em>BED</em> room 
					</li>

					<li> My parents left El Salvador when I was 3. My father left
						for the U.S. first, tried 3 times before he succeded.
						My mother soon followed. So they left before my brain
						could actually store memories. My grandmother was left
						in charge of me for a year before my parents decided
						to have me brought to them
					</li>

					<Li> I was 4 years old when I left El Salvador. I had full
						awareness of most things that went on by then. So I do 
						recall most of the things that happened as I made 
						my trip out of my home country and into the U.S. My
						uncle did start out the trip with me. But we got 
						separated half way. They caught him, and he got 
						deported. Out of all the people that were in the 
						group with me, I was the only one that made it 
						into the U.S. I got so many anecdotes about the whole
						thing, but you all would be reading this for maybe
						3 hours.

			<h1 id="HO">Hobbies</h1>

			<article>
				<p>I have many hobbies. And always search to get into 
				new hobbies. Having hobbies tells so much about a person.
				I see hobbies as a way to pass time, yes. But I also see 
				it as a way to improve myself. Once you get into something
				and you realize that you are good at it, and you know what
				you are doing... something clicks. And it kind of becomes
				an obsetion. Maybe even addiction. But as my father has
				always said, "It's better to have something good to do 
				so you don't get lost down the wrong path"
				</p>

				<p>The hobbies I have right now include: 
					<ul>
						<li>Art: mostly sketching and coloring ocassionaly</li>
						<li>Playing Instruments: I've learned a good amount
							of different instruments. The ones I play the most are 
							guitar and piano </li>
						<li>Skateboarding: I recently got into skateboarding. I worked
							 in Cambridge. Alot of Colledge students come and go there 
							 and that means they through a lot of things out. I salvaged 
							 the skateboard I'm using to learn right now.
						</li>
						<li>Producing Music: I started recording and producing beats and Music
							about 3 years ago. I do have a very low budget of about $0 USD.
							So everything I make is made with my phone with free DAW
							apps I've found. (I recommend BandLab)
						</li>
						<li>Gaming: I've slowly drifted away from gaming. But I still enjoy a
							good ol' gaming session.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<article> 
					<p>
						I've had a great journey. Scouring Youtube for the most obscure
						genres of music possible. I've gone from Cumbia to Trap, form
						Rock to Bachata, from Bluegrass to Hyperpop, from Midwestern
						Emo to Folk Punk, form... well you get the idea
					</p>

					<p>I also make music. So here are a few tracks I've made</p>
